Upgrade steps
=============

Here we do some testing of various mostly simple upgrade steps.  It is
not always practical to do things like mess up the portal_workflow,
then run our workflow upgrade step and check if this fixes it.  But we
can at least run the step to see if it runs successfully.  Also,
running a step twice should work too.

Upgrade steps are run as admin, with the portal_setup tool as context:

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> context = self.portal.portal_setup

Run the workflow step:

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import run_workflow_step
    >>> run_workflow_step(context)
    >>> run_workflow_step(context)

Run the rolemap step:

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import run_rolemap_step
    >>> run_rolemap_step(context)
    >>> run_rolemap_step(context)

Run the sharing step:

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import run_sharing_step
    >>> run_sharing_step(context)
    >>> run_sharing_step(context)

Run the types (typeinfo) step:

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import run_types_step
    >>> run_types_step(context)
    >>> run_types_step(context)

Remove a no longer needed form controller action:

    >>> from Products.Poi.migration import remove_form_controller_action
    >>> remove_form_controller_action(context)
    >>> remove_form_controller_action(context)
